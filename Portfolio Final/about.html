            <p>Hello, my name is Terrence Erkerd, I'm 38 years old.  I’m an upcoming web developer that loves to be creative and never afraid of going outside my comfort zone.  
                I got a intern position as a network administrator and realized, it wasn’t for me.  It took me a few weeks to figure out what I wanted to go to school for.  
                I remember my wife wanted her own website to sell her books and t-shirts and I told her I started creating my own website years ago but never did anything with it.  
                So, I told her I will work on hers and see if I still got that “creative juice”. When I was creating her website, I realized how much I enjoyed working on it.  
                I told myself, I still got it! So that is what got me on the web development career path. I have already created three websites for three different business owners and their users love using the sites.  
                In the beginning I didn’t know I wanted to be a web developer. I was going to school to become a network administrator.  
            </p>

            <p>I really look forward to learning new techniques to improve my developing skills.  By taking some classes at Wake Tech, I really feel my skills and understanding of web developing has improved.  
                To add more to my sites, I am learning how to create programs like calculators, forms etc.  
                I plan on using this knowledge to build the websites that my customers will be happy to call their own. 
                Today’s web development has really made it easier for web developers to build the perfect site for their customers. 
                Sites like Wix.com has really helped me improve my skills and knowledge on how to build the perfect site. 
                By working with my users, it helps to get as much feedback as I can get to make sure the site is to their liking. 
                Wix makes it easy to show my customers step by step process because they only see the frontend development, so I can better communicate with them. 
                Not sure how other developers did it years ago but today it is so much smoother on both ends. 
                I am so happy to be in this career path because I really enjoy helping people build their business and dreams.
                Learning about HTML, CSS and PhP has really gave me the upper hand so I can give a high level of support my customers and the knowledge to get a full time job as a web developer, until I build my business where I want it to be.
