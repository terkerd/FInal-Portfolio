                    <h2> Welcome to my website!</h2>

                    <p>
                        
                        Hello, my name is Terrence Erkerd. I’m an upcoming web developer that loves to be creative and never afraid of going outside my comfort zone. In the beginning I didn’t know I wanted to be a web developer. 
                        I was going to school to become a network administrator. I got a intern position as a network administrator and realized, it wasn’t for me. It took me a few weeks to figure out what I wanted to go to school for. 
                        I remember my wife wanted her own website to sell her books and t-shirts and I told her I started creating my own website years ago but never did anything with it. So, I told her I will work on hers and see if I still got that “creative juice”. 
                        When I was creating her website, I realized how much I enjoyed working on it. I told myself, I still got it! So that is what got me on the web development career path. I have already created three websites for three different business owners and their users love using the sites. 
                        I really look forward to learning new techniques to improve my developing skills. By taking some classes at Wake Tech, I really feel my skills and understanding of web developing has improved. Learning about HTML, 
                        CSS and PhP has really gave me the upper hand so I can give a high level of support my customers and the knowledge to get a full time job as a web developer, until I build my business where I want it to be.

                                        <p>This is the first site I ever created. This site was designed for my wife. It's been a while since it's been updated and 
                                            it needs some updates and improvements. All the things I've learned while in school has helped me improve in my skills. Look forward
                                            to improving her site in the future. <a href="https://www.iamcletheartist.com/">CLE The Artist</a>

                                        <p>I created this site for my wife's friend a year ago. It took me awhile because I had a hard time getting the mobile verison to
                                            display correctly. This was because I haven't taken classes that gave me a deep understand fluid and mobile friendly site buidling. I think
                                            I did okay and with all the information I've received, I will use all my notes on my next project.

                                            about adobe photo shop. This gave me the chance to really dig deep into the software and I feel I did a really good job and she loved
                                            it.
