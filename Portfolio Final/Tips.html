  <h2>&#9733; Web Site Ideas &#9733;</h2>
    <p>This page is to help you decide what type of website would fit mine and my customer's needs. Also to see what 
      type of budge am you are looking at. Having a budge is key to make sure you're not using too much or too less to reach
      your customers. If you have any questions, please <a href="contactme.html">click here</a> to contact me.

    </p>

    <h4>&#9733; Start with a simple site plan</h4>
    <p>
      1. Grab a piece of paper and map out the pages you want in your main navigation menu. List any other subpages and where they’ll go.
       This will help you stay organized and show you the pieces of content you need before you start building.
    </p>

    <h4>&#9733; Keep your navigation menu short</h4>
    <p>
      2. Related to the site plan, you want to make sure your DIY website doesn’t have too many options in the menu. 
      A menu bar that overflows onto two lines or has a lot of submenus is confusing and hard to use. 
      A good rule of thumb is to have no more than 5-7 pages in your top navigation menu. 
      Your website will look more streamlined and your customers will have an easier time finding what they need—a win/win.
    </p>

    <h4>&#9733; Think about your audience</h4>
    <p>
      3. If you know specifically who you are trying to reach, you can create a website that’s targeted to what they need. Defining who your website is for 
      (and not for) will make it easier to create a focused, successful do it yourself website. And remember, your audience probably isn’t 
      “everyone”—that goal would be too broad.
    </p>

    <h4>&#9733; State Your Purpose Clearly and Quickly</h4>
    <p>
      4. You do, however, want to make sure that the written content of your website isn’t too long-winded. Website visitors don’t often 
      spend a lot of time reading through pages of content just to find basic information. 
      So make sure that the important points about your company and its offerings are very clear and easy for visitors to find.
    </p>

    <h4>&#9733; Use high-quality photos, even if they are stock photos.</h4>
    <p>
      5. Stretching a low-quality photo into a large background image is tempting, but it’s not going to look very good. If your photos look grainy, pixelated,
       or blurry, this means they are not high-quality enough for the size you’re aiming for.
    </p>

    <h4>&#9733; Include Customer Testimonials</h4>
    <p>
      6. Customer testimonials can be another great element of a lot of business sites. 
      If your business is brand new, work on getting some quality testimonials first, rather than just publishing bland, 
      generic recommendations. But even a few text blocks from customers can help build your credibility.
